# Wiredesignz's CI_Lang library

This is a fork of Wiredesign's excellent Language handler for the Codeingiter framework. 

I can't find this online, which is why I'm publishing here. All credit for the work goes to Wiredesgnz. 

My only change is the name of the library from CI_Language to CI_Lang. There may be minor customizations to MY_url_helper.php too.
